# Anticverse
"Anticverse" is a company that prioritizes the utilitarianism of human beings by expressing the mind-forming in a micro-cultural sense, under the leadership of its multi-disciplinary and self-taught education. Although it is a practical company, in theory, it is a rhizomatic school.

Anticverse is a philosophy-based informatics team that works with meta-archetypes of technologies.

Anticsophia formation, which creates the basis for Anticverse, has been actively carrying out philosophy and art activities for four years, aiming for the benefit of the masses. With sudden developments in its technological interests, it transformed into the Anticverse informatics team. This transformation saw its beginnings and got presented to the public with the game project "The Orpheus". Following this radical change, our team's search for engineers and designers began.

Anticverse Labs is the company of the future that builds and studies web development, artificial intelligence, blockchain technologies, virtual reality, and game development of myths for different purposes.
